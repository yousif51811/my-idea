    <h1>My idea</h1>
    <p>I have an idea to make LFG so much easier and allow gamers to connect anywhere in the world. just by a click of a button you could find someone to play games with. wether its minecraft or fortnite mabye cod it doesnt even matter. you could even voice call or talk through text with them. im not exactly good at coding so yeah this may take a while to make. </p>
